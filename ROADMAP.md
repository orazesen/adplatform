## 💪 You Can Do This!

This roadmap is ambitious but **achievable**. Companies like ScyllaDB, Redpanda, and ClickHouse were built by small teams with the right technology choices.

**Key to success:**
1. **Start small** - MVP in 2 months
2. **Measure everything** - Profile constantly
3. **Scale gradually** - Don't over-engineer
4. **Learn continuously** - Read papers, study competitors
5. **Optimize ruthlessly** - Every nanosecond counts

**Your advantages:**
- Modern tech (Rust, Glommio, ScyllaDB)
- No legacy code
- Performance-first mindset
- Self-hosted (no cloud markup)

Let's build the fastest ad platform in the world! 🚀
