# 🚀 AdPlatform - The World's Fastest Ad Platform

> **Enterprise-grade advertising platform built for billion requests/second**
> 
> Built with Rust, C/C++, and SolidJS for bare-metal performance

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a **Google Ads-scale advertising platform** that is:
- ⚡ **Ultra-fast**: <1ms p99 latency, 1B+ RPS at scale
- 💰 **Cost-effective**: 100% self-hosted, zero paid cloud services
- 🔒 **Private**: Full data ownership and control
- 🛠️ **Customizable**: Complete source code access
- 🌍 **Scalable**: From MVP to global hyperscale

## 🏆 Why This Will Be The Fastest

### Technology Choices

| Component | Technology | Performance |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Core Framework** | Glommio (Rust) → Seastar (C++) | 1.1M → 6M RPS/core |
| **Networking** | DPDK + XDP/eBPF | Kernel bypass, 100Gbps+ |
| **Serialization** | Cap'n Proto | Zero-copy (0ns deserialize) |
| **Database** | ScyllaDB | 10x faster than Cassandra |
| **Cache** | DragonflyDB | 25x faster than Redis |
| **Analytics** | ClickHouse | 1B rows/sec scans |
| **Frontend** | SolidJS | Fastest reactive framework |

### Architecture Principles

```yaml
✓ Thread-per-core (no context switching)
✓ Lock-free data structures (no contention)
✓ Zero-copy everywhere (no memcpy)
✓ SIMD operations (8-64x parallelism)
✓ io_uring (async I/O)
✓ Huge pages (fewer TLB misses)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adplatform
cd adplatform

# Start databases
docker-compose up -d

# Run development server
cargo run --bin api-gateway

# Load test

## 📊 Performance Targets

| Phase | Timeline | RPS | Latency p99 | Cost/month |
|-------|----------|-----|-------------|------------|
| **MVP** | Month 2 | 10k | 100ms | $200 |
| **Production** | Month 4 | 100k | 10ms | $1k |
| **Scale** | Month 8 | 1M | 5ms | $3k |
| **Global** | Month 12 | 10M | 2ms | $24k |
| **Hyperscale** | Year 2 | 100M | 1ms | $100k |
| **Google-Scale** | Year 3 | **1B+** | **1ms** | $400k |

## 💡 Why This Works

**Economics:**
- Physical server: $200/month (32 cores, 128GB RAM)
- Equivalent cloud: $2,000/month (10x markup!)
- At scale: Save 90% vs cloud providers

**Technology:**
- Rust/C++ = bare-metal performance
- io_uring (2019+) = game-changing I/O
- ScyllaDB = proven 10x faster than Cassandra
- DPDK = 100Gbps on commodity hardware

**Performance compounds:**
```
2x faster code → 50% fewer servers → 50% less cost
→ More R&D budget → Even faster code (virtuous cycle)
```

## 💪 You Can Do This!

**This is ambitious, but absolutely achievable.**

Examples:
- ScyllaDB: Small team, now industry standard
- Redis: Built by one person (Antirez)
- Google/Facebook: Started in dorms/garages

**Your advantages:**
- Modern tooling (Rust, io_uring)
- Open source ecosystem
- This comprehensive blueprint
- Self-hosting = 10x cost advantage
