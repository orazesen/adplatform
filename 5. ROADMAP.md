# 🗺️ Implementation Roadmap - Zero to Hyperscale

## Overview

This roadmap takes you from **MVP (Month 1) to 5B+ RPS Hyperscale (Year 3)** with realistic milestones and performance targets at each phase.

**Strategy:** Start with Glommio Rust (fast to develop), migrate hot paths to Seastar C++ for maximum performance.

- Choose final architecture (DONE!)
- Set up CI/CD

### Deliverables

```yaml
Infrastructure:
  - ✅ Rent 3 physical servers (Hetzner/OVH)
    - 1x Dev server (32 cores, 128GB RAM) - $100/month
    - 2x Production servers (64 cores, 256GB RAM) - $200/month each
  - ✅ Set up Git repository
  - ✅ Set up CI/CD (Tekton or GitLab CI)

Development:
  - ✅ Monorepo structure
  - ✅ Rust workspace configuration
  - ✅ Seastar C++ setup (for Phase 2+)
  - ✅ Docker images (Alpine-based)
  - ✅ Development environment

Documentation:
  - ✅ Architecture docs (DONE)
  - ✅ Tech stack (DONE - FASTEST STACK)
  - ✅ Performance guide (DONE)
  - ✅ API design (TODO)
```

### Technology Decisions (FINAL)

```yaml
Hot Paths (Phase 2+):
  Framework: Seastar C++
  Reason: 6M RPS/core, proven at ScyllaDB/Redpanda scale
  Services: Ad serving, RTB bidding, Analytics ingestion

Services (Phase 1+):
  Framework: Glommio Rust
  Reason: 1.1M RPS/core, safer than C++, easier development
  Services: Campaign mgmt, Auth, Billing, Reporting

Serialization:
  Internal: Cap'n Proto (0ns deserialization)
  External: FlatBuffers (10ns)

Databases:
  Cache: DragonflyDB (25x faster than Redis, Seastar-based)
  Primary: ScyllaDB (10x faster than Cassandra, Seastar-based)
  Analytics: ClickHouse (1B rows/sec)
  Queue: Redpanda (10x faster than Kafka, Seastar-based)

## 💪 You Can Do This!

This roadmap is ambitious but **achievable**. Companies like ScyllaDB, Redpanda, and ClickHouse were built by small teams with the right technology choices.

**Key to success:**

1. **Start small** - MVP in 2 months
2. **Measure everything** - Profile constantly
3. **Scale gradually** - Don't over-engineer
4. **Learn continuously** - Read papers, study competitors
5. **Optimize ruthlessly** - Every nanosecond counts

**Your advantages:**

- Modern tech (Rust, Glommio, ScyllaDB)
- No legacy code
- Performance-first mindset
- Self-hosted (no cloud markup)

Let's build the fastest ad platform in the world! 🚀
